I wanted to take a moment to appreciate Sachin for the support and guidance he’s extended to me—especially when we started working together on the SDP project. Being a completely new space, there was a lot to figure out early on, and his clear direction and hands-on help made it much easier to get started. He was always willing to answer my questions (no matter how basic) and share his approach to solving issues. I’ve picked up a lot just by working alongside him, and I really value the time and effort he’s taken to help me grow.
