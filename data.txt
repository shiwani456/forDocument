Collaboration & Inclusion:
I consistently worked in a collaborative way across teams and projects, ensuring open communication and shared ownership. I actively participated in KT sessions with senior team members and conducted KT sessions for new joiners, helping them feel included, supported, and confident from the start.

Integrity & Trust:
I maintained transparency in my work by clearly communicating progress, risks, and dependencies, especially during release and support activities. I followed processes, respected timelines, and ensured commitments were met, which helped build trust within the team.

Ownership & Accountability:
While working on multiple projects in parallel, I took responsibility for assigned tasks end to end and supported teammates during high-priority situations, including releases and production support.

Excellence & Continuous Learning:
I focused on continuous learning and knowledge sharing by creating clear documentation and improving team workflows, helping the team work more efficiently.
