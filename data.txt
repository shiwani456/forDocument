This year, I consistently worked toward driving operational excellence by improving system reliability, reducing manual effort, and supporting smooth releases while working on two projects in parallel. I contributed to stable operations by supporting multiple releases (June, October, and November) through IPlan creation, bundle preparation, CRQ support, and deployments, ensuring changes were delivered in a controlled and predictable manner.

I improved operational efficiency by building automation scripts such as installer.sh, prereq.sh, and a PowerShell cleanup utility, which reduced manual installation and maintenance effort. I also created Helm charts for certificate and configuration deployment, helping standardize deployments across environments.
